       <h4>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun,
            and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work,
             which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often
             an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.</h4>
        <h4>French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men),
             defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character</li>
            <li>separate: it is circumscribed in time and place</li>
            <li>uncertain: the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable</li>
            <li>non-productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful</li>
            <li>governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life</li>
            <li>fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality</li>
        </ul>
